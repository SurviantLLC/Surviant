# Fixes for Surviant Website

This document outlines the fixes made to address issues in the codebase.

## Issues and Fixes

### 1. Duplicate Component Paths
- **Issue**: The application had duplicate components with the same name in different locations:
  - `components/services-section.tsx` and `components/sections/services-section.tsx`
  - `components/particle-field.tsx` and `components/ui/particle-field.tsx`
  - `components/ui/use-mobile.tsx` and `hooks/use-mobile.tsx`
- **Fix**: Standardized imports by using the versions in their appropriate directories.

### 2. Media Query Hook Infinite Loop
- **Issue**: The `useMediaQuery` hook in `hooks/use-media-query.ts` had `matches` in its dependency array, causing potential infinite re-renders.
- **Fix**: Removed `matches` from the dependency array, making the hook only re-run when the query changes.

### 3. Missing Null/Error Checks
- **Issue**: Components like `section-indicator.tsx` didn't handle edge cases (empty arrays).
- **Fix**: Added proper checks to handle empty arrays and undefined values.

### 4. String Manipulation Without Validation
- **Issue**: `interactive-card.tsx` used `split()` on strings without checking if the format was valid.
- **Fix**: Added safety checks and default values to prevent runtime errors.

### 5. Scrolling Navigation Issues
- **Issue**: Wheel events needed better handling and explicit documentation.
- **Fix**: Improved the wheel event handling and added better comments to explain the scroll behavior.

### 6. Mobile Hook Implementation
- **Issue**: The mobile detection hook was duplicated and inconsistently implemented.
- **Fix**: Provided a single, optimized implementation that uses a consistent approach to detect mobile devices.

## How to Apply the Fixes

The fixed files are available in the `fixed-files` directory. You can:

1. Compare the changes between the original and fixed files
2. Copy the fixed files to replace the originals
3. Test the application to ensure everything works correctly

### Key Fixed Files
- `/fixed-files/page.tsx.fixed`
- `/fixed-files/hooks/use-media-query.ts.fixed`
- `/fixed-files/components/ui/section-indicator.tsx.fixed`
- `/fixed-files/components/services-section.tsx.fixed`
- `/fixed-files/components/ui/interactive-card.tsx.fixed`
- `/fixed-files/hooks/use-mobile.tsx.fixed`

## Additional Recommendations

1. Delete duplicate files after fixing the imports:
   - Choose either `components/ui/use-mobile.tsx` or `hooks/use-mobile.tsx` (recommend keeping only the one in `hooks/`)
   - Remove one of the `services-section.tsx` files (recommend keeping the one in `components/sections/`)

2. Add ESLint rules to catch these types of issues in the future:
   - Rules for hook dependencies
   - Type checking for string operations
   - Duplicate export detection

3. Consider adding unit tests for critical components to prevent regressions
